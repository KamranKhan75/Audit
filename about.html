                    <p>My History Audit Vehicle Reports began out of a desire to take the vehicle history report
                        industry to the next level. For too long almost no competition existed for these reports.
                        CarFax®, and later on AutoCheck®, both continued to increase prices, all the while providing
                        fewer and fewer services to their customers.
                        <br><br>
                        So My History Audit Vehicle Reports went about changing the way the industry did business. We
                        looked at new ways of offering our clients the critical information they needed in a vehicle
                        report. In the end, we chose the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) as our
                        primary sourcing tool because it offered us a database of tens of millions of used vehicles, a
                        database that is not only updated regularly, but is well-known for its accuracy. At the same
                        time, we developed a relationship with an exceptional group which provides fast and timely lien
                        data for millions of used vehicles.
                        <br><br>
                        We believe everyone is entitled to a fair price on a vehicle history report, since this
                        information is absolutely essential to your making the right decision on a used vehicle. Of
                        course, we help more than just individual buyers make smart decisions about used cars. If you
                        are a dealer selling used vehicles, our website will promote your vehicles by giving your
                        clients all the necessary information about them.
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, we tried to provide services that our competition simply wasn’t offering. So we began
                        providing certain auto auction information, such as whether or not a used vehicle has ever been
                        in one, for free. We even give you a free picture of your vehicle at the auction when available.
                        <br><br>
                        We’re always looking for new ways to make My History Audit Vehicle Reports great. Send us your
                        feedback today, and let us know how we can make your life easier when you need a vehicle history
                        report.

                    <p><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Customer service is open 7 days a week</p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Everyday we actively seek out any unsatisfied customers

                        our competitors. This is leading to massive savings for our customers with the millions of
                        reports sold. With our Volume Discount packages customers can save even more.</p>

                    <p>Although we had a great year in 2016, we will also be the first to admit some areas where we came
                        up short and we will ensure that these issues are fully resolved in the last quarter of 2017.
                    </p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Each site will only have one credit card descriptor starting
                        in March, we have noticed that when the credit card descriptor changes or doesn't fully relate
                        to the product they purchased some of our customers may get confused.</p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> We have completely redone our back end to make its simpler
                        and easier for our customers to access the report they buy, this will largely eliminate any
                        consumers be unable to open their report.</p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> we have completely redesigned our reports to offer the
